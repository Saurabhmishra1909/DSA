Geek has to choose a book of a particular kind and read it loudly as many times as he can in the given time and earn points. Geek knows that reading a book of kind <strong>i</strong> once needs <strong>arr1</strong><sub>i</sub> minutes and it will give him <strong>arr2</strong><sub>i</sub> points. Geek has <strong>k</strong> minutes for reading books. During this time, he can only read a book of a particular kind as many times as he can so as to maximize his points. But he can not pick books of different kinds. Find the maximum points Geek can get.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input:</strong> k = 10, arr1 = [3, 4, 5], arr2 = [4, 4, 5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 12
<strong>Explanation: </strong>If Geek picks book of first kind he can read it 3 times, he will get 3*4 = 12 points. If Geek picks book of second kind he can read it 2 times, he will 2*4 = 8 points. If Geek picks book of third kind he can read it 2 times, he will get 2*5 = 10 points. So the maximum possible points which he can earn in those 10 minutes is 12.<br></span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input:</strong> k = 12, arr1 = [8, 5], arr2 = [100, 5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 100
<strong>Explanation: </strong>If Geek picks book of first kind he can read it 1 times, he will get 100*1 = 100 points. If Geek picks book of second kind he can read it 2 times, he will 5*2 = 10 points. So the maximum possible points which he can earn in those 12 minutes is 100.</span></pre>
